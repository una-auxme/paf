**Summary:** This file explains the Cruise behavior.

## General

This behaviour has the lowest priority one and will be executed when no other behaviour is triggered.

It does not do much, as in the normal cruising the holding of the lane and speed control is done by different parts of the project.

--> speed control = acc with speed limits and other limits \
--> following the trajectory = acting

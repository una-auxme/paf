# Final Presentation Guidelines

The purpose of the final presentation is to showcase the project's results and reflect on the work done. The following guidelines provide a structure for the presentation and additional tips for a successful demonstration.
Do not make the mistake of overselling your project. Be honest about the challenges you faced and the limitations of your solution. The goal is to present your work in a clear and understandable way.

## 1. Technical Aspects

- Zoom Recording:
  - Are we allowed to record audio and screen?
  - The recording may be provided to PAF25 as an introduction to the project.
  - If anyone objects, please inform us in advance.

- Presentation Equipment:
  - Ensure that the technology works beforehand (laptop, projector, sound, internet).
  - If specific software or hardware is required, consult with the supervisors in advance.

## 2. Presentation Structure

Possible topics to cover:

### 2.1. Introduction & Objectives

- What was the overarching goal of the project?
- Why is this topic relevant?

### 2.2. Initial Situation & Problem Statement

- What was the state of the art when you started? Strengths and weaknesses of the project.
- Which existing solutions did you build upon?
- What challenges did you face at the beginning?

### 2.3. Improvements & Solutions

- What works better now?
- What solutions were implemented?
- Why were certain approaches chosen?

### 2.4. Validation of Improvements

- How was success measured?
- Are there measurable results, diagrams, or comparative data?

### 2.5. Open Challenges

- What still does not work well?
- Where did unexpected problems occur?

### 2.6. Future Perspectives & Recommendations

- What should be improved next?
- What open questions or to-dos exist for future teams?

### 2.7. Reflection

- What would you have done differently in hindsight?
- Which methods or approaches would you use again?

### 2.8. Demonstration Videos

- Demonstration videos are always appreciated.
- However, if you ever have to manually intervene during the demonstration, clearly explain why and what you are doing.

## 3. Additional Guidelines

### 3.1. Tips for a Good Presentation:

- Clear and concise slides (avoid overloading with information).
- Prefer practical examples & demos (if possible).
- Short, understandable explanations.
  - Avoid excessive technical depth for unnecessary details.
- Manage time effectivelyâ€”do not spend too long on one topic.

### 3.2. Questions & Discussion:

- Be prepared for critical questions.
- If someone cannot answer a question immediately, the team can step in.

### 3.3. Evaluation Criteria (Possible Aspects):

- Clarity of the presentation
- Explanation/visualization of the technical implementation & solutions
- Reflection & lessons learned
- Quality of responses during the Q&A session

## 3. Special Circumstances

### 3.1. Unable to Present Work Due to Scheduling Conflicts

- If you completed the sprint’s work but cannot present it, you have two options:
  1. Play the standard Joker card.
  2. Use a `Presentation Only Joker Card` by arranging for a teammate to present on your behalf.

- **Presentation Only Joker Card Details**:
  - **Maximum Use**: Limited to two times throughout the project.
  - **Requirements**:
    - Notify the team and chair at least **7 days** before the sprint review.
    - Submit a written summary of your work to the Digicampus according to the [Sprint Summary Template](./templates/sprint_summary_template.md).
    - Find a teammate who presents your work.

> [!CAUTION] Presentation Only Joker Card
> We encourage all team members to only present your teammates work if absolutely necessary.
> The work completed by your colleagues is their responsibility, and they should be the ones to present it.
> Furthermore, you should only present their work if you are familiar with it and can answer questions about it.
> Additionally, you should be confident that your team member has completed the work to a satisfactory standard.

### 3.2. Illness or Emergency

- **Illness**: If you cannot attend due to illness, provide a medical certificate to be excused from duties without using a Joker card.
- **Emergency**: Emergencies are evaluated individually.

# Student Roles for Autonomous Vehicle Development Team

## Role overview

2-4 Students per Role

- **Systems Engineer**
  - Oversee the entire development process, ensuring smooth interaction between different subsystems (perception, planning, control, decision-making, etc.).
  - Define system-level architecture, ensuring each module (e.g., sensors, planning, control) interacts through well-defined interfaces.
  - Manage requirements (e.g. in issues) and ensure each team's outputs align with the overall system goals, including performance, reliability, and safety standards.
  - Serve as the point of contact for inter-team communication, ensuring alignment between roles such as Perception Engineers, Control Engineers, and Decision-Making Engineers.
  - Take responsibility for identifying and managing dependencies between subsystems and methods, especially in relation to the timeline. Ensure that the sequence of development is logical and efficient, avoiding resource investment in features that rely on unfinished or unavailable modules. 
    - For example, avoid focusing efforts on decision-making algorithms that depend on perception data (e.g., stop lines) if it’s clear that the sensors or detection mechanisms won't be ready until later stages of the project.
  - Develop and enforce a systems integration strategy that covers continuous testing, validation, and verification of the autonomous driving stack.
  - Ensure proper data flow between modules using middleware (e.g., ROS).
  - Define and monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) for each subsystem, ensuring they collectively meet reliability, stability, and safety goals.
  - Provide leadership in prioritizing tasks, resource allocation, and responsibility distribution, ensuring the team meets project milestones.
  - Guide the team in prioritizing tasks and responsibilities, ensuring timely progress toward milestones.
  - Create detailed, version-controlled documentation of system design, module interactions, integration protocols, and architectural decisions, ensuring scalability and ease of future development.
  - Lead risk management efforts, identifying system-level risks and developing mitigation strategies.
  - Focus on the system’s overall functionality, making sure that all subsystems work harmoniously to create a reliable, autonomous vehicle capable of safe driving in the CARLA simulation.
- **Decision-Making Engineer**
  - Develop the vehicle’s decision-making logic for dynamic driving scenarios (e.g., merging lanes, overtaking, yielding at intersections).
  - Implement high-level decision-making algorithms (e.g., rule-based systems, behavior trees, or reinforcement learning) to choose the best action at any given time.
  - Ensure the vehicle follows traffic laws, responds to signals and signs, and interacts safely with other vehicles and pedestrians.
  - Design algorithms to handle edge cases, such as sudden obstacles, unpredictable pedestrian behavior, construction sides or vehicle breakdowns.
  - Collaborate with perception, planning, and control engineers to ensure the decision-making module aligns with the data and actions generated by other subsystems.
  - Simulate and validate decision-making in various complex driving scenarios within CARLA, such as navigating congested traffic or adverse weather conditions.
  - Ensure decision-making algorithms are interpretable and explainable to enhance debugging and safety validation.
- **Perception Engineer**
  - Develop and improve sensor models (e.g., camera, LiDAR, radar) within the simulation, ensuring realistic sensor behavior and noise characteristics.
  - Implement state-of-the-art object detection, tracking, and sensor fusion algorithms to accurately interpret environmental data.
  - Work on the perception stack to enhance environmental understanding (e.g., detecting vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, road signs, and obstacles).
  - Optimize sensor fusion techniques to combine data from multiple sensors for robust and reliable perception.
  - Collaborate with Machine Learning Engineers to incorporate deep learning models into the perception pipeline, improving detection accuracy and real-time performance.
  - Ensure the perception system performs reliably under diverse conditions (e.g., weather changes, lighting variations, sensor occlusion).
  - Continuously validate the perception module using test cases in CARLA, ensuring the system adapts to changing environmental conditions.
- **Localization and Mapping Engineer**
  - Improve vehicle localization by fusing GPS, IMU, vision-based techniques, and other sensor data for precise vehicle positioning.
  - Work on the integration and optimization of high-definition (HD) map usage provided by the simulator, ensuring accurate and up-to-date environmental mapping.
  - Implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithms to improve real-time localization in unknown environments.
  - Optimize the robustness of the localization system to handle edge cases, such as GPS signal loss, complex urban areas, and off-road scenarios.
  - Collaborate with the Systems Engineer and Perception Engineers to ensure the localization system integrates seamlessly with other modules.
  - Continuously test and validate the localization system to ensure accuracy and reliability across different environments and conditions in the CARLA simulation.
- **Path Planning Engineer**
  - Implement motion planning algorithms to generate smooth, safe, and optimal driving paths in complex environments.
  - Develop and improve path planning algorithms (e.g., A*, RRT, D*), ensuring that the vehicle can navigate through traffic, avoid obstacles, and follow traffic laws.
  - Collaborate with Decision-Making Engineers to ensure the planned paths align with high-level driving decisions.
  - Optimize planning algorithms to handle real-time changes in traffic conditions, road structure, and dynamic obstacles.
  - Validate the planned paths in various CARLA scenarios, ensuring robustness and reliability in urban, rural, and highway environments.
  - Ensure path planning algorithms balance safety, efficiency, and passenger comfort while maintaining vehicle controllability.
- **Control Systems Engineer**
  - Work on the low-level control of the vehicle, including steering, throttle, braking, and handling.
  - Implement advanced control algorithms (e.g. MPC) to ensure the vehicle follows planned paths with stability and precision.
  - Tune control parameters to ensure smooth and reliable vehicle behavior under dynamic environmental conditions.
  - Collaborate with Path Planning Engineers to translate high-level paths into precise control actions.
  - Ensure the control system reacts dynamically to changes in the environment (e.g., obstacles, traffic conditions).
  - Test and validate control algorithms in CARLA, ensuring they handle edge cases like sudden maneuvers or high-speed scenarios.
- **Testing and Validation Engineer**
  - Design and execute comprehensive test cases to validate the performance, safety, and reliability of the autonomous vehicle system.
  - Develop automated testing pipelines within the CARLA environment to streamline regression testing and continuous integration.
  - Analyze the car’s performance under different driving scenarios (urban, highway, adverse weather) and provide detailed feedback to other engineers.
  - Generate detailed performance reports and feedback loops, recommending improvements to systems engineering, decision-making, and perception.
  - Suggest important next steps and priorities to the Systems Engineer based on testing outcomes and system performance.
  - Collaborate with all teams to ensure that testing covers a broad range of scenarios, including edge cases and stress tests.

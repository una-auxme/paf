# Builds and development quick links

This file is a short pointer to the per-component documentation. The detailed CARLA build & publishing information lives under `build/docker/carla`.

- CARLA builds and publishing: `build/docker/carla/README.md`
- CARLA publishing (GHCR): `build/docker/carla/push-to-ghcr.md`
- Helpful scripts: `scripts/check-nvidia.sh` and `scripts/update-dotenv.sh`

If you need the full developer guide, see the `doc/development` and `doc/general` folders.
